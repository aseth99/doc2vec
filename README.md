# doc2vec
me trying to implement a doc2vec algorithm


I think doc2vec is similar to word2vec, as it takes in a big training set (can feed it a text file with basically unlimited lines of text) then assigns each document a vector space. Then we can input a sentence/phrase/document, and find similar documents.

This can be effected drastically by the data set we use to train the network.
